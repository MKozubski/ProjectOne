  <h1>About Dog Breeds Web Application</h1>
  <p>We're happy you're here because the Dog Breeds Web Application is a platform for
  learning about a variety of dog breeds and their sub-breeds. Our program connects to
   outside data sources and arranges the data for your benefit.</p>

  <h2>Data Sources</h2>
  <p>We obtain data from an external API endpoint that offers thorough details
  about different dog breeds. This API provides information on breed names and the
   corresponding sub-breeds.</p>

  <h2>Data Structure</h2>
  <p>The data retrieved from the Dog API is structured in a JSON format.
  The primary key is the breed name, and its value is an array. This array contains
   names of the sub-breeds if any. If a breed has no sub-breed, the array is empty.</p>

  <p>Example:
    {
        "affenpinscher": [],
        "bulldog": ["boston", "english", "french"],
        ...
    }
  </p>

  <p>Our database consists of two main tables:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Breeds Table:</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <table border="1" style="width:50%">
    <tr>
      <th>Column</th>
      <th>Data Type</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>id</td>
      <td>Integer (Primary Key)</td>
      <td>Unique identifier for the breed.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>name</td>
      <td>String</td>
      <td>Name of the breed.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>SubBreeds Table:</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <table border="1" style="width:50%">
    <tr>
      <th>Column</th>
      <th>Data Type</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>id</td>
      <td>Integer (Primary Key)</td>
      <td>Unique identifier for the sub-breed.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>name</td>
      <td>String</td>
      <td>Name of the sub-breed.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>breed_id</td>
      <td>Integer (Foreign Key)</td>
      <td>Relates the sub-breed to its parent breed (foreign key to Breeds table).</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <h2>Integration of Data</h2>
  <p>The primary source of data is the Dog API, which offers a catalog of breeds
   and their respective sub-breeds. This data lays the foundation of our application,
   presenting users with a hierarchical structure of canine variety. Integrating this
   data into our platform, we aim to offer users the opportunity to explore and delve into the
 nuances of each breed and sub-breed, ensuring an informative and comprehensive browsing experience.
 By utilizing the Dog API, our application promises a rich and detailed view into the captivating world of
  dog breeds, presenting each one's unique characteristics and distinctions.</p>

  <h2>Data Initialization</h2>
  <p>We populate our database by fetching data from the Dog API and processing it using a seed script.
   The script creates records for each breed and their associated sub-breeds, ensuring that the
   information is up-to-date and accurate.</p>
